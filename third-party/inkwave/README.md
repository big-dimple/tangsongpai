- `src/ui/ui-util.js` L81–96: Spring integrator adapted in `src/game/inkwaveSpring.ts`. TypeScript, fixed 60-step lookup for existing Phaser tween easing, no extra update listener. Applied to hero strike/number recovery and opening name/voice stagger; existing reduced-motion and owned tween cancellation remain.
- `src/audio/audio.js` L258–280: minGap and per-sound oldest-voice cap adapted to per-semantic multi-layer recipes in `AudioEngine.cue`. Existing app context, bus/mute/visibility, event identity and cleanup remain. Local round-robin variants replace pitch jitter; no domain RNG.
- `src/audio/audio.js` L425–449: 75ms paired confirmation timing adapted to actual recorded chip transaction layers, not its synthesized voices.

- `src/ui/menu-art.js` InkWipe L285–309, L344–384: cancellation/token guard, rAF starvation timeout and three-wave edge adapted in `src/game/PaperFlow.ts`. A 240ms narrow translucent paper/ink strip replaces the opaque full wipe, particles and SQUID mark. Scene routes execute immediately exactly once; no delayed onMid callback. App/OS reduced motion, blur, visibility, resize and game destruction cancel the visual layer. No asset or domain RNG added.

No V.tone/V.nz, shooter engine, fonts, songs, 3D assets or debug freeze were imported. Demo playback/hearing was not verified: parent's cloud browser stopped at5% with WebGL Disabled. These are actual code adaptations, not a claim of demo or human audiovisual acceptance.

## 2026-10-09 complete opening rhythm adaptation

- styles/ui.css64–72,778–785: title entrance and squash/ring timing adapted to the existing title art and existing Phaser spring easing.
- src/ui/menus.js582–589: bounded200ms confirmation followed by the existing immediate scene route.
- src/ui/menu-art.js209–226,258–310,372–448: moving bounded droplets, expanding rings and1000ms cover/reveal, in existing paper/ink/red palette. Title and first saved hero stage share InkBurst; foreground motion remains behind numerical readout. Route/hero remain one saved-event stage; the existing extra500ms is unchanged. Full reveal may be skipped by input without owning or repeating the route. Reduced motion bypasses it. The earlier light240ms adaptation remains for other transitions.
- src/audio/audio.js726–734: low body / filtered air / tail structure adapted using existing licensed recorded material only. No upstream synthesized noise/tone imported. This is code-reference adaptation; upstream full browser playback and subjective listening were not verified.

## 2026-10-15 loading theatre

`src/game/LoadingScreen.ts` reuses the existing attributed `inkSettlingEase(.5)` from `src/game/inkwaveSpring.ts` for three bounded decorative card-outline echoes. That module is the MIT spring adaptation documented above (98ea296, `src/ui/ui-util.js` L81–96). The full original MIT notice remains here and in the runtime distribution at `public/assets/licenses/Inkwave-MIT.txt`; both SHA-256 `aa94b137dc8ec64c7f78f66c71070a78c528a100e26fcfbd30eec06737413f41`.

The new inline SVG mountains, concentric sun, river lines, motes, suit paths, paper-card ornament, CSS entrances and layout in `index.html` are original to this project. No upstream artwork, font, music, logo, loading code, or full-screen ink wipe was copied. Progress uses actual decoded counts, with no animation completion awaited.

Reference access was attempted again on 2026-10-15. `https://inkwave-aah.pages.dev/` returned a proxy CONNECT 403 / Chromium `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED` in this execution environment. Git clone, GitHub API metadata and raw historic revision retrieval for `jaydendavisnc/inkwave` returned 404. The web reader returned only the live page title, no source or loading visuals. Therefore this change does **not** claim a fresh inspection of the live reference loading performance or its current source/license; attribution relies on the preserved prior licensed adaptation, which was actually read locally. See this batch's reference-access evidence for exact results.
